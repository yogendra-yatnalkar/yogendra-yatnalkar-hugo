## About Me:

![](index/dbe15eb43570e14c754478fe250f1003a321be0c.jpg)

I am a **Senior Machine/Deep Learning Engineer** at **Quantiphi Analytics**. I have been working professionally (and in the AI domain) **since August 2020**. After working on various data-domain, I think that I am more inclined towards Computer Vision (I am biased). I have industry experience across various use-cases ranging from: 

- Image Segmentation (**U2Net**, **UNet, SegmentAnything ..**.... the list is quite big)

- GAN's (Trained and deployed **custom GAN** to generate shadows below car)

- **Video Data:** Video Deduplication **(Worked on 50 TB+ of raw video files for the task of de-duplication)****, Ad-Brand-Identification from sports-videos

- Churn Prediction (Worked on **1.5+ TB of CSV** data to generate 80+ features to predict churn in **EdTech domain**) --> Worked with a lot of **SQL🔥!!**

- **MLOps** on **AWS** (Few tags: Pipelines - Airflow/SageMaker-Pipeline, Drift, Retraining, automatic trigger, Explainability.....)

- **Tagging** (On different time-lines, I have managed more than 8 taggers to for more than 2 months to tag **thousands of images for segmentation, GAN's and object detection**)

- Object Detection (Used **Yolo v5**to detect web-elements on web-page)
  
  (I think I should stop........ the list will become un-readable now....)
