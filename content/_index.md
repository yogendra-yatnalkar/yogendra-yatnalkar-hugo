## About Me:

<!-- ![](index/dbe15eb43570e14c754478fe250f1003a321be0c.jpg) -->

I work as an **AI Engineer @ Google (GCP)** with four years of industry experience. Previously, I worked at **Quantiphi Analytics** as a **Senior ML Engineer**. I have in-depth experience with **AWS** and **GCP**, as well as some experience with **Azure**.

Since I recently started at **Google**, Iâ€™ll update the information below in the coming months. For now, here is an overview of the work I did at **Quantiphi**:

  - **ML Engineer**: Developed custom ML/DL solutions for global clients, with hands-on experience in:
    - **Tabular Data**: Churn prediction, classification, and other similar use cases
    - **Computer Vision**: Expertise in segmentation, object detection, image similarity, video deduplication, video analytics, and more
    - **MLOps**: Extensive work with SageMaker Jobs, SageMaker Pipelines, and Airflow, including building components for processing, training, monitoring, and explainability
    - **NLP**: Built LLM- and RAG-based chatbots using AWS Bedrock and AWS OpenSearch
  - **Research Engineer**: Primarily focused on Computer Vision research with two main activities:
    - Exploring new techniques and papers to identify potential applications within ongoing projects
    - Evaluating the performance and usability of new AWS ML services
  - **Pre-sales ML Consultant**: Supported the sales team by engaging with customers, understanding their challenges, and proposing solutions, particularly for Computer Vision use cases.
