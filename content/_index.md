## About Me:

![](index/dbe15eb43570e14c754478fe250f1003a321be0c.jpg)

I am a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer with over three years** of industry experience, working mainly on **AWS** cloud and partly on **GCP** cloud. In my current organization, I play three roles:

- **ML Engineer**: I develop custom ML/DL solutions for global clients. 
  - Have hands-on experience with:
    - **Tabular-Data:** Churn Prediction, Classification, etc
    - **Breadth and Depth of Computer Vision domain:** Segmentation, Object Detection, Image Similarity, Video Deduplication, Video Analytics, etc.
    - **MLOps:** SageMaker Jobs, SageMaker Pipelines, Airflow, Building Components like: Processing, Training, Monitoring, Explainability, etc
    - **NLP**: Currently building LLM and RAG based chatbots using AWS Bedrock and AWS OpenSearch.
- **Research Engineer**: I primarily focus on Computer Vision research and have two main activities: 
  - I explore new techniques and papers and try to see if they can be applied to any of the current projects (i.e., I try to find applications of the latest papers).
  - I explore new AWS ML services and evaluate their performance and usability.
- **Pre-sales ML Consultant**: I also **assist the sales team** in my organization by interacting with customers, understanding their problems, and proposing possible solutions, especially for Computer Vision use cases.

### Few Technical Achievements:

- I developed and deployed a custom¬†**GAN model for ‚ÄúShadow Generation below objects‚Äù**¬†in early 2022.
- I was one of the core developers of Quantiphi‚Äôs **MLOps product** on AWS : **‚ÄúNeuralOps‚Äù**.
- **Conducting research on:** 
  - Backtracking AWS Lookout for Vision (I was **recognized by AWS Community Builders** for this)
  - **Multi-Task Learning**
  - **Prompt-less Finetuning** of MetaAI Segment Anything model (SAM)
  - **Balancing Loss impact** on ML training where multiple loss metrics are used simultaneously 
  - ..... and many more
- **Experience on GPU**: 
  - **Training** a salient image segmentation model **for seven days on a single GPU** in 2021
  - **Exploring Multi-GPU training** with Horovod, Pytorch DP, Pytorch DDP, etc
  - Hosting large ML models on **AWS Inferentia**
  - **Using FFMPEG on GPU** for large-scale audio-video transcoding.
  - .... and many more
- **Working at scale:** 
  - ¬†I worked on **1.5 TB of CSV data** for churn prediction use case. 
  - Worked on **70+ TB of raw audio-video data** for content-deduplication use case
