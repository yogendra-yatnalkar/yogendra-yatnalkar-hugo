## Un-Answered Questions:

- Difference between Float16 vs Bfloat16 vs Tensor-Float16 ?

- Vector Databases: HNSW vs IVF ?

- Difference between vector DB's and FAISS library (by Meta) ? 
  
  - From my current knowledge both are same, but then why is everyone behind vector DB's instead of using FAISS directly ?
