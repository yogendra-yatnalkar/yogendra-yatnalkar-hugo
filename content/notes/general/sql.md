# SQL Notes:

## Cross Join vs Full Join:
- **Full join** (which is always outer), requires atleast 1 common key/column between 2 tables which are about to be joined
- **Cross Join** does not need any kind of **ON** clause (which is common column) between two column. Every row one table will get associated with every row of ther other table. 

## General Notes:
- There is nothing called as **Left Inner Join** or **Right Inner Join** .... WHY ?? .... beyond my wildest imagination :)
