## Linux:

### Wget vs Curl

- curl and wget both support http and various types of FTP protocols. 
- curl is library but wget is a CLI tool. 
- curl is used for both way data transfer (src to detination and vice-versa)
- But, wget can be used only for single way data transfer, example: downloading something form a web-server.
