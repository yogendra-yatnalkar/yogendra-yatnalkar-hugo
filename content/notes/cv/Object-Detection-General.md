# Object Detection Notes:


- **Reckognition vs Detection**:
    - Reckognition is a classification task to decide if a object is present or not (in image or within the predicted bounding box) 
    - Detection: Predict the coordinates of the object in the image
        - initially it used to be done using Regression but with YOLO, even this task is treated as a classification task
